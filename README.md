# Uno Bot

Status: In-progress

Throughout my childhood, Uno has always been the go-to card game to play with my friends and family. Even going into my adulthood, I would occasionally play the mobile version of Uno. People always say ‘Uno is based on luck”. I agree, somewhat. However, a part of me believes that skills also matter. Sure, a lot of times you might only have one obvious play to make, and that does not require any skills. However, for times when there are multiple valid plays to choose from, I believe skills is what help you maximize your win rate. The more I ponder on this, the more I want to dive deeper into this topic. Therefore, for this project, I will be discovering an optimal strategy of playing Uno that could give you a win rate higher than 50% and to prove that Uno is in fact based on luck AND skills.

For this project, I will only be discovering an optimal strategy for playing against a player, a 1v1 Uno game. My project will consist of two parts: a game engine of the UNO card game, and using the game engine to train an agent to use an optimal strategy. For the game engine, I will be using Python to build it from scratch and use pygame to build a simple GUI. For the agent, it will be using the Q-learning algorithm to find an optimal strategy to play the game.
